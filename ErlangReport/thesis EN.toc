\contentsline {section}{\numberline {4}Insight Question}{33}{section.4}%
\contentsline {subsubsection}{\numberline {4.0.1}spawning a process in Erlang is a very lightweight operation: a newly spawned Erlang process only uses 309 words of memory. How has this influenced your solution? Imagine the cost of creating a process was much higher, e.g. if you were using Java and created new Threads: how would this affect the performance and how could you improve this? }{33}{subsubsection.4.0.1}%
\contentsline {subsubsection}{\numberline {4.0.2}Twitter and Threads provide two types of homepage: "Following" and "For You". The page "Following" contains the timeline as we implemented it, consisting of a chronological list of messages from the users you follow. The page "For You" contains a list of messages that are gathered both from users you follow as well as other "popular" messages on the platform, and are then sorted using a machine learning algorithm. How would you implement this in your system? Do not focus on the machine learning algorithm, but discuss the impact on the architecture and performance of your system.}{34}{subsubsection.4.0.2}%
